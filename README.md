# Presidential-Transcripts

The purpose of this research project was to provide a leverage for researchers who want to analyze trends in Presidential documents.

In my project, I constructed document web scraper using BeautifulSoup to scrape the documents, I programmatically extracted meaningful data objects by looking into the metadata using Regex, and I built backend that queries presidential documents using Python(Flask) and SQL and the front end of this web application using HTML, CSS, and JQuery.
